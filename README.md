# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-BINARY-SEARCH-USING-8085-ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE-
In this project, we embark on a journey to bridge the gap between algorithmic theory and  practical execution. We'll delve into the intricacies of the 8085 microprocessor, gaining an  understanding of its architecture and instruction set. This knowledge will serve as the  foundation for crafting an efficient binary search routine
